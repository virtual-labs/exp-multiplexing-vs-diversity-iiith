To analyze the spatial multiplexing vs diversity trade offin a Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) system, please follow the following steps :
  1) Enter the input values for number of transmit antennas (maximum value is 6), number of recieve antennas (maximum value is 6), SNR.
  2) Select the optimization mode : Fox the  multiplexing or diversity and enter its value. This value should be less than $\min(N_t, N_r)$.
  3) The system automatically assigns the remaining antennas for diversity (in the case of fixed multiplexing) and for multiplexing (in the case of fixed diversity).
  4) Repeat the experiment with different values of and analyze the changes in multiplexing and diversity.
     
      - If r increases, diversity d decreases, reducing resilience to fading.

      - If r decreases, diversity d increases, improving reliability.
