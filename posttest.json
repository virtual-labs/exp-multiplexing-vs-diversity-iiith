      "question": "Which of the following best describes the trade-off between diversity and spatial multiplexing in MIMO?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Both increase simultaneously with more antennas",
        "b": "Maximizing one usually reduces the other",
        "c": "They are independent of each other",
        "d": "Diversity is only used when multiplexing fails"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect – adding antennas can increase both, but usually not to the maximum simultaneously.",
        "b": "Correct – in practice, optimizing for one often reduces the other.",
        "c": "Incorrect – they are closely linked through the diversity–multiplexing trade-off.",
        "d": "Incorrect – diversity is a design choice, not a fallback."

        "d": "Bandwidth and frequency"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect – DMT is not about total power.",
        "b": "Incorrect – error rate and delay are not the DMT axes.",
        "c": "Correct – higher multiplexing gain boosts data rate but reduces reliability, and vice versa.",
        "d": "Incorrect – bandwidth and frequency are unrelated to the DMT directly."

      "question": "Which of the following correctly explains the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff at high SNR?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It disappears at high SNR",
        "b": "Increasing diversity gain always increases multiplexing gain",
        "c": "There exists a fundamental tradeoff between the two, even at high SNR",
        "d": "Multiplexing gain is always better than diversity gain"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect – the trade-off still exists at high SNR.",
        "b": "Incorrect – improving one often comes at the expense of the other.",
        "c": "Correct – the DMT remains valid regardless of SNR level.",
        "d": "Incorrect – neither is inherently 'better', it depends on channel conditions."

      "question": "In practice, how is the trade-off between multiplexing and diversity typically handled?",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect – only using diversity wastes potential capacity.",
        "b": "Incorrect – modern systems use flexible designs.",
        "c": "Correct – systems adapt based on SNR, fading, and required QoS.",
        "d": "Incorrect – ignoring the channel is inefficient."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect – grouping for diversity reduces independent channels.",
        "b": "Incorrect – grouping usually lowers the number of SISO channels.",
